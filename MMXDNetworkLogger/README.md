# MMXDNetworkLogger
A logger for ROCKMAN X DiVE. Logs requests/responses and socket protocol packets.
Everything is logged in readable form as much as possible, except server responses as they need to pass through mutliple arbitrary functions in the client to be fully processed.

Tested in BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-be.673.
